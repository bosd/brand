This module was adds the functionality to use brand watermarks
(backgrounds) to PDF reports. This module will not add any reports on
itself. It rather provides a "Use Brand Watermark" check box on reports.
And allows you to define a brand specific pdf watermark. You will need
to use it in combination with a module which adds branding possibilities
to an model such as ``account_brand``. If the box is checked and pdf
watermark is added to a brand. Then the watermark is added to the pdf.

``account_brand`` module you need to:

   ``account.report_invoice``)
2. Under Advanced Properties, Check the box "Use Brand Watermark".
