This module was adds the functionality to use brand watermarks (backgrounds) to PDF reports.
This module will not add any reports on itself. It rather provides a "Use Brand Watermark" check box on reports.
And allows you to define a brand specific pdf watermark.
You will need to use it in combination with a module which adds branding possibilities to an model such as `account_brand`.
If the box is checked and pdf watermark is added to a brand. Then the watermark is added to the pdf.
